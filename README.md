#Introduction
This project is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game designed to be played in the console. It's a great example of a basic interactive Python script, demonstrating concepts like user input, random number generation, conditional logic, and loops.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Play against an AI opponent.
Clear Rules: Winning rules are displayed at the start.
Input Validation: Ensures valid choices (1, 2, or 3) from the player.
Replay Option: Allows players to continue playing multiple rounds.
User-Friendly Interface: Clear prompts and results.
How to Play
Run the script.
Choose your move: Enter 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors.
See the outcome: The game will display both your choice and the computer's choice, then declare the winner.
Play again: You'll be prompted if you want to play another round. Enter Y to continue or N to quit.
Installation
This game requires Python 3.x to run.

Clone the repository (or copy the code):

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rock-paper-scissors.git](https://github.com/rakibul5656)
cd rock-paper-scissors
(Replace YOUR_USERNAME and rock-paper-scissors with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

No additional libraries are required. The game uses only built-in Python modules.

Usage
To start the game, simply run the Python script from your terminal:

Bash

python rock_paper_scissors.py
(Assuming you named your Python file rock_paper_scissors.py)

Game Rules
The classic rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors apply:

Rock vs Paper: Paper wins (Paper covers Rock)
Rock vs Scissors: Rock wins (Rock smashes Scissors)
Paper vs Scissors: Scissors wins (Scissors cuts Paper)
If both players choose the same hand, it's a draw!
